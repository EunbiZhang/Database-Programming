# Database-Programming
a PostgreSQL database 

The project includes:

1. A C++ program to read text files containing the entries (rows) for each table, and build the database by creating each table and adding entries.

2. A C++ library (set of functions) which will provide an interface for a program to interact with the database (e.g. add rows to the tables and query for certain information).
